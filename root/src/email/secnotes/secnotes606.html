<b>Coast to Coast run – Epic! And Sunday Scramble</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0cm; text-indent: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0.32cm; line-height: 116%">
What a huge success! Overnight leading into Drive it Day in April saw
the first CT Coast to Coast run. This event was in Lieu of the Home
Counties Run, (HCR) which has sadly suffered dwindling support in
recent years.   The C2C event was sold out! Starting at Anglesey Race
Circuit was an inspired choice as the venue, staff and even the food
were all excellent. The sighting laps were fun and left me wanting
more. The route across country was well planned by the organisers and
was easily achievable within the time limits. I missed some of the
‘fun’ elements of the HCR and the extra camaraderie at the finish
but that’s just a personal note. Well done to Chris Shaw, Ellis,
Dale and Nigel.

International weekend which this year includes the Standard Triumph
Marque Day is now being advertised as hosting ‘Pistons in the Park’
at Lincoln Show Ground Please see the advertisement elsewhere in the
magazine for ticket information.  The cost of venues and declining
active membership is making it extremely difficult for individual
Clubs to host major events these days but CT was warmly welcomed by
the TR Register the last time it invited us along in 2016. Hope to
see some of you in June. The venue is nearby to RAF Scampton and the
‘Dambusters Inn’ is well worth a visit.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"><b>OlaF and Evie.
Running reports.</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"> Well following on
from my last report I’ve used up most of the polish I bought at the
time of my last message, but not on Olaf or Evie. I have been helping
to get Chris Banks’s Mk 2 2000 auto ready for the road. Chris and
Tony Pulis carried out a suspension and brake system rebuild last
year and Chris has refurbed the wheels and fitted new tyres to the
car that had spent it’s last few years in a barn on the Isle of
Wight, It had been parked up in a seaside car park before being
discovered some years later in a barn by Angela Cotton and her
partner Graham who introduced the car to Chris. My involvement has
entailed a lot of fettling and fiddling and the fitting of a new
distributor, all rubber hoses and pipes, all belts, an alternator and
a myriad of other parts. The biggest problem of all was a blocked
fuel line which finally came to notice after several failed attempts
to cure the poor fuel flow involving replacement mechanical pumps,
electrical pumps and various other idea’s. the final diagnosis
involved a flap of PTFE! This had been used on the fuel tank union
and turned out to be the cause of much head scratching and mirth on
the part of Mr and Mrs Banks who had no faith that Chris’s car
would ever leave their front drive under its own steam again. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%"> My promise to
report back on some suspect parts can only be partially reported on
as I received a refund from Mr Rimmer for the brake drums but I have
yet to resolve the starter motor issue. Olaf suffered a big puncture
and has had a new tyre fitted and I took the opportunity of fitting a
matching one to the spare wheel that I picked up at Stoneleigh. A
visit to the Beaulieu Spring Auto Jumble yielded a bit of a haul of
body parts and I now have an almost full ‘Kit’ ready for Olaf’s
big rebuild after the RBRR. More next time.</p>

Dates</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 100%">The CT Scenic and
Continental French Tour will take place between June 4<sup>th</sup>
-11th June 2019. Late advice meant that the part of the trip that
includes two nights in Verdon has been upgraded to half board at a
spa resort. The final price is £879 per head. This is a lot of money
I know but please see the itinerary on the Club Forum or Facebook and
in the article in next month’s mag. This is a big tour over 8
days/7 nights covering over 2000 miles and takes in a visit to Le
Mans, with time to drive the public part of the circuit and visit the
museum, onward to the war memorial at the abandoned Village at
Oradour sur Glane, a full Millau bridge experience and some of the
most spectacular scenery France has to offer in the Volcanoes
National Park and the Spectacular Gorges du Verdon where there will
be a day of down time before the drive home which includes a visit to
the old Grand Prix circuit at Reims. Ferries and 3/ 4 Star hotels
(B+B) are included as well as road books giving alternate routes and
the holiday is fully ABTA backed.  I hope for more and the tour will
be open to all Standard Triumph owners. Other Classic cars are also
welcome. Come on let’s have some fun! It’s quite a hike to the
deep south but the driving should be well within everybody’s
distance capabilities and the memories will be epic!

that if members are paying for separate items/services that they
provide one cheque for all items and make a note of amounts on the

as required as this will reduce costs to the Club.</p>
